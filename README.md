# RINGME - Remote Mobile Management Android Application
‘RING ME’ is a new mobile management Android application which allows you remotely perform various tasks from any other mobile device just by sending simple SMS commands. The phone from which we are sending messages need not be an Android phone – even the basic mobile handset which can send SMS would do just fine. The operation is easy. You send an SMS command from another phone to your phone in a registered format and the app responds based on it. For example, a SMS command like ‘ring’ would turn on the ringer of the phone
